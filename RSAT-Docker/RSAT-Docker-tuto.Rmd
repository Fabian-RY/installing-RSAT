# Introduction

This page explains how to install an interactive Docker container of the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools. 

# Requirements

## Availability

RSAT Docker containers are available at https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/rsat/tags .

## Operating systems

Docker containers have so far been tested on Linux and Windows systems. <!--and Mac OS systems. -->

Please let us know or send us a PR at https://github.com/rsa-tools/installing-RSAT if you succeed in running it on other settings.

## Docker 

To run containers you must have Docker installed in your system. 

You can find instructions for installing the Docker (Server) engine on **Linux** at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server .

On **Windows**, our recommended procedure is to i) install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and then ii) the Docker engine:

 * The installation of WSL is simple, as it you can fetch it from the Microsoft Store for free (read more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and 
[here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-generally-available-on-windows-10-and-11/)).
 * The installation of Docker engine within WSL is explained at https://dev.to/felipecrs/simply-run-docker-on-wsl2-3o8 and https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu .

<!-- 
We have also tested the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), 
which is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows systems, but c

**Note:** see [instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61530874/docker-how-do-i-add-myself-to-the-docker-users-group-on-windows) to add your Windows user to the 'docker-users' group, you will need admin privileges. -->

# Installation instructions

If you want to fetch a ready-to-run Docker container with RSAT please select a tagged version from https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/rsat/tags . 

The steps below are for version **rsat:20230602_cv1**, you might change it as needed for other versions:

 1. Download a container (this will take 10GB of your filesystem):

        # from the Linux/WSL terminal
        docker pull biocontainers/rsat:20230602_cv1
        
    <!--This can also be done from the Docker Desktop app, as shown in the figure:
    ![](./DockerDesktopWindows.png) -->
        

 2. Create local folders for input data and results, outside the container. In the example two folders are created, named *rsat_data/* and *rsat_results/*, which are placed in the current location ($HOME). In addition, a subfolder (*rsat_data/genomes*) is also created and permissions are changed so that anyone can write there. Note those command lines will work equally on Linux/Windows systems. **Note:** you can place these folders anywhere in your system, but please check their paths and modify them in **step 3** accordingly:
 
        # assuming you are at $HOME 
        mkdir -p rsat_data/genomes rsat_results
        chmod -R a+w rsat_data/genomes rsat_results

 3. Launch Docker RSAT container. Note that the local folders from **step 2** are mounted as volumes in the container. If you changed their locations please adjust their paths to the right of the colons. **Note:** after this instruction, all other commands should be typed and executed at the container's terminal. :

        docker run --rm -v $HOME/rsat_data:/packages/rsat/public_html/data/ -v $HOME/rsat_results:/home/rsat_user/rsat_results -it biocontainers/rsat:20230602_cv1
        
        # you should see a warning that can be safely ignored: 
        #
        # * Starting Apache httpd web server apache2
        # (13)Permission denied: AH00091: apache2: could not open error log file /var/log/apache2/error.log.
        # AH00015: Unable to open logs
        # Action 'start' failed.
        # The Apache error log may have more information


 4. Download organism from public RSAT server, such as the Plants server. Other available servers are http://fungi.rsat.eu, http://metazoa.rsat.eu, http://protists.rsat.eu and http://teaching.rsat.eu

        download-organism -v 2 -org Prunus_persica.Prunus_persica_NCBIv2.38 -server https://rsat.eead.csic.es/plants

 5. Test container:

        cd rsat_results 
        make -f ../test_data/peak-motifs.mk RNDSAMPLES=2 all

 6. To install any organism, please follow the instructions at [managing-RSAT](https://rsa-tools.github.io/managing-RSAT/genome_installation/install_organisms_FASTA_GTF.html).

 7. To connect to RSAT Web server running from Docker container (Linux only): 

        # to start the Docker Web server launch the container and do (check password in Dockerfile):
        sudo service apache2 restart
        hostname -I # should return IP address

        # finally open the following URL in your browser, using the IP address, ie http://172.17.0.2/rsat

# Dockerfiles

Dockerfiles for the containers at [biocontainers/rsat](https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/rsat) 
can be found at https://github.com/BioContainers/containers/tree/master/rsat

Those are based on a standalone Dockerfile, available at https://github.com/rsa-tools/rsat-code/tree/master/docker, which we use for testing.
